            Armwrestling Academia is a project by athletes of the sport to help bring useful information about the training and methodologies of Armwrestling that really work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Unfortunately, as the sport is relatively new, it is experiencing its formal years in the era of Social Media.
            </p>
            <p>
            This means that huge amounts of personal opinions and unconfirmed information is represented with equal value alongside proven data, so for the actual Athlete it becomes very difficult to decipher what will actually be beneficial for them.
            </p>
            <p>
            One way to overcome this issue is to hire a personal coach to filter that information for the athlete.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, nobody likes to spend more money than they need to.
            </p>
            <p>
            So, Armwrestling Academia strives to bring as much useful information to you in one condensed area, so you can find what you need to know, when you need to know it.
