            Armwrestling Academia is a project by athletes of the sport to help bring useful information about the training and methodologies of Armwrestling that really work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Unfortunately, as the sport is relatively new, it is experiencing its early years in the era of Social Media.
            </p>
            <p>
            Huge amounts of unconfirmed information is represented with equal value alongside proven data. So, it becomes very difficult to decipher what will actually be beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
            One way to overcome this issue is to hire a personal coach to filter that information for the athlete.

            However, nobody likes to spend more money than they need to.
            </p>
            <p>
            So, Armwrestling Academia strives to bring as much useful information to you in one condensed area, so you can find what you need to know, when you need to know it.
